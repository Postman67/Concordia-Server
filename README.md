# Concordia Server

Real-time chat server built with **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
Architecture is intentionally simple so the client team can build on top of it quickly.

## Quick start (Docker — recommended)

Two deployment modes are available. Both persist data via named Docker volumes.

### Option A — Single container *(easiest)*

PostgreSQL and the Node server run together in one image. No `.env` required for a basic setup.

```bash
# Start (builds on first run)
docker compose -f docker-compose.single.yml up --build

# The server is now available at http://localhost:3000
```

> Set `ADMIN_USER_ID` in a `.env` file (or inline) to bootstrap an admin account on first start.

### Option B — Two containers *(recommended for production)*

PostgreSQL and the server run as separate services, making it easier to back up the database, scale, or upgrade each component independently.

```bash
# 1. Copy the env template and fill in the required values
cp .env.example .env
#    → set DB_PASSWORD and JWT_SECRET at minimum

# 2. Start everything (Postgres + server)
docker compose up --build

# 3. The server is now available at http://localhost:3000
```

The first time the server starts it will automatically run `migrations/001_schema.sql`,
which creates the schema and seeds a **#general** channel.

## Deploy to Railway

Railway runs the **Node server** as a standard Railpack service. PostgreSQL is a separate
Railway-managed database — no Docker or single-container image required.

### 1. Create the project

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or connect it in Railway directly)
2. In Railway click **"+ New"** → **"GitHub Repo"** → select `Concordia-Server`
3. Railway detects `railway.toml` and uses Railpack automatically

### 2. Add PostgreSQL

1. In your Railway project click **"+ New"** → **"Database"** → **"Add PostgreSQL"**
2. Railway creates a managed Postgres instance and injects `DATABASE_URL` into every
   service in the project automatically — no connection string to copy or configure
3. The server connects on startup and runs migrations automatically

### 3. Add a volume (persistent media)

Railway's default filesystem is ephemeral — files are lost on redeploy. To persist
uploaded server icons and media:

1. Open the **Concordia-Server** service → **Volumes** tab
2. Click **Add Volume**
3. Set **Mount path** to `/data/media`
4. In the **Variables** tab add `MEDIA_PATH=/data/media`

The volume is mounted at that path at runtime and survives deploys and restarts.
`MEDIA_PATH` tells the server where to read and write files.

### 4. Set environment variables

In the service **Variables** tab:

| Variable | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_USER_ID` | **yes** | Your Federation user UUID (bootstraps server owner on first deploy) |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | **yes** | Your frontend URL e.g. `https://app.concordiachat.com` |
| `MEDIA_PATH` | **yes** | `/data/media` |
| `FEDERATION_URL` | no | Only needed for self-hosted Federation — omit to use the public one |

> `DATABASE_URL` and `PORT` are injected by Railway automatically. Do not set them.

## Local development (no Docker)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node 20+, a running Postgres 14+ instance

npm install
cp .env.example .env   # edit DB_* and JWT_SECRET

npm run dev            # ts-node-dev with live reload
```
